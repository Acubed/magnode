The simple but stern coding guidelines:

TABS TO INDENT.

SPACES TO ALIGN.

No trailing whitespace at the end of a line. This means no indents on blank lines. (No /[ \t]+$/ or /^[ ]+/ matches).

Any time asynchronous functions are called in parallel, they must be marked with a docblock comment (/** */ style) containing the text "Parallel query" as so:
	/** Parallel query */
We need to keep track of where we run asynchronous tasks in parallel.

http://semver.org/ is the only way to number it, folks.
