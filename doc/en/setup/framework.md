## Framework Setup

Magnode can be used as a framework, where most of a website's functionality is defined programmatically, instead of by database.

You will need to setup the library calls to get Magnode functioning as an application. This will need to include:

* Database connection
* RDF/URI environment
* Authentication and authorization
* Create the render and import transforms
* Routing URLs
* Listening to ports

A good starting point for developing your application as a framework is looking at the `httpd.js` file.

For information about how to setup Magnode as a framework, see the [Developer's Guide](#developer) and the [API Documentation](#api).
