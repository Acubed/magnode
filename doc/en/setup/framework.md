## Framework Setup

Magnode can be used as a framework, where most of a website's functionality is written in JavaScript, like standard Node.js Web applications.

You will need to setup the library calls to get Magnode functioning as an application. This will need to include:

* Database connections
* The CURIE/RDF/URI environment
* Authentication and authorization
* Defining renders/formatters/transforms
* Routing URLs
* Listening for connections

Some examples of applications are the `httpd.js` file and the simple examples in `setup/examples-*/`

For information about how to setup Magnode as a framework, see the [Developer's Guide](#developer) and the [API Documentation](#api).
