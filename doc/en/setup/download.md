## Download

Magnode is available for download in a number of different ways, each are aimd at slightly different audiences.


### Tarball

The tarball package can be downloaded, and contains the complete core sources, dependencies, and might be available in different _distributions_ which contain additional functionality pre-installed or pre-configured.


### Vanilla Git

Also known as the Git tree, this is the core Magnode source code. This ships with the bare basics to be able to publish a blog or other largely static website with a limited number of users. This requires use of Git and dependencies must be pulled in.


### Packages

Functionality can be added to your program by installing packages, or installing modules to function-specific module directories.
