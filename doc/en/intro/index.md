## Magnode
Magnode is a **framework** and **application** that formats, publishes, and manages **dereferenced RDF resources**. In layman's terms, it's a **content management system**. Magnode is written in ECMAScript (that is, Javascript) on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Magnode changes the CMS game by preserving the notion of data throughout the entire process of handling it, all the way through to output. By utilizing RDFa templates, it's possible to extract the very data that was used to generate the page. Magnode does this by using _transforms_ that converts one type of data (say, a blog post) into another type of data that's closer to final output (which would be an HTTP response containing an HTML webpage, to complete the example). And since Magnode is built on Node.js, it's fully evented, and is a perfect match for Nginx for publishing high-performance websites. And since Node.js runs Javascript, Magnode is written in _the_ language of the World Wide Web, letting the web browser and the server run the _exact same code_.
