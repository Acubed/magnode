## Magnode
Magnode is a **framework** and **application** that formats, publishes, and manages **dereferenced RDF resources**. In layman's terms, it's a **content management system**. Magnode is written in ECMAScript (that is, Javascript) on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Magnode preserves the notion of data throughout the entire process of handling it, all the way through to output. Magnode does this by using _transforms_ that converts one type of data (say, a database row about a blog post) into another type of data that's closer to final output (like an HTTP response containing an HTML webpage). And since Magnode is built on Node.js, it's fully evented, and is a perfect match for Nginx for publishing high-performance websites. And since it runs ECMAScript, Magnode is written in _the_ language of the World Wide Web, letting the web browser and the server run the _exact same code_.
