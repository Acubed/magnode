## Download
Magnode is available as a number of different _distributions_. The core Magnode sources, the "vanilla distribution" doesn't have very much and probably doesn't have what you want. Instead, a number of specialized distributions are made available. The neapolitan contains many common modules and semantics to build basic websites.

### Vanilla
The core Magnode sources.

### Neapolitan
All the officially supported features shipped together.

### Blog
Ships with blog-specific templates and semantics.
