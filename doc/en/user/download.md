Magnode is available as a number of different _distributions_. The core Magnode sources, the "vanilla distribution," doesn't have very much stuff most people probably want. Instead, a number of specialized distributions are made available. The neapolitan contains many common modules and semantics to build many kinds of websites.

### Vanilla
Also known as the Git tree, this is the core Magnode source code. This ships with the bare basics to be able to publish a blog or other largely static website with a limited number of users.

### Neapolitan
All the officially supported features shipped together.
