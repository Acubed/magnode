## Taxonomy
Often it is useful to classify and order resources. You may want to organize a collection of artwork by its medium, or a collection of literature by its topic, you would create a _taxonomy_.

Magnode uses the standard terms `rdfs:subClassOf` and `rdf:type`/`a`, and usage of RDF Collections to organize content, and for more advanced usage, the [SKOS vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer) which is designed for this purpose. There is a taxonomy API to use to gain access for use when formatting classifications of resources for display.
