## Installation
Magnode is its own web server, so it does not need to be installed to the web root of your system, it doesn't need a web server at all. You may choose to use a web server to cache and load-balance Magnode and to serve static resources on disk, those static resources would need to go in your web root (see the section on Nginx for this usage).
