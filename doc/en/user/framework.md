## Framework Setup

Magnode can be used as a framework, where most of a website's functionality is defined programmatically, instead of by database.

You will need to setup the library calls to get Magnode functioning as an application.

The installer script currently works this way to produce an `httpd.js` file, the source for a basic framework-application can be examined at `setup/example-blog/httpd.js`.

For information about how to setup Magnode as a framework, see the [Developer's Guide](#developer) and the [API Documentation](#api).
