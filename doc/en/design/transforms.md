## Transforms
The core of Magnode is the transform process. To date, most content management systems use a "partials" template system, whereby data for a page body is formatted with one template (selected depending on the data type), and then the formatted body is included in a master template for final output. The transform process instead accepts input resources and requested output types, and applies predefined transforms to generate new resources of different content types that are closer to the requested output types. Input resources may be an RDF typed literal, a Javascript object, or a URI that identifies a resource to be transformed. In order to do this, Magnode creates the notion that Javascript objects and specific typed literals may also be instances of a Class.

Take for instance formatting a blog post. The intended output is an HTML document `http://magnode.org/DocumentHTML`, and the database connection provided as type `http://magnode.org/Database` and a blog resource URI `http://magnode.org/2011/01/02/a-blog-post` provided as type `http://magnode.org/Blog` are provided as inputs. There may not be a single transform to take a blog resource and format it as an HTML document, but there is one transform that takes a blog post resource and a database connection and generates an HTML body of types `http://magnode.org/DocumentHTML_Body` and `http://magnode.org/DocumentHTML_BodyBlog`, and another transform that transforms the HTML body into the target output (`http://magnode.org/DocumentHTML`).

To know which transforms to apply, each transform has an associated _domain_ and _range_. The domain of a transform is all the inputs that it requires to operate, and the range is the types that the transform will output. Because these are predefined, the transform engine can calculate which transforms to apply before actually running them.
