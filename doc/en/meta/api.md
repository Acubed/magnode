## The API Documentation
The API documentation is built directly from the source code and RDF facts that are gleaned from comments.

### Code
Code Metadata (Extracting information from code, like API documentation)

The code should be self-documenting:

	// @param Object dbs {name: Object} map of resources
	module.exports.prototype.seed = function(dbs){
		/* ... */
	}
