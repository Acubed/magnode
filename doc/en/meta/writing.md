## Writing
Please help submit documentation.

Each section (User's Guide, Developer's Guide, Design, etc) is intended to be a stand-alone section, so information may be redundant between the sections. The purpose and target audience of each section should be self-explanatory.

The non-API documentation is referred to as the tutorials, and is written as Markdown documents filed in the `doc/src/` directory, organized by language.

The documentation is kept in the Magnode repository and is intended to describe that revision of Magnode. It should not store upgrade information or release notes, this is information to be posted on the mailing list and other places where the releases are made. Release notes can also be generated from the Git commit log. The documentation may diverge from the actual functionality for short periods of time, but this should be considered a bug, and is not stable software. The documentation should be updated alongside the code, if features are introduced. With autogenerated API documentation this shouldn't be too much of a consern but keep aware.

Like in source code, don't refer to specific bug numbers, instead describe the rationalle in a nutshell. Bug numbers should only be mentioned in the release notes.

Don't demonstrate ways that one should not do something, only demontrate the correct way to do something.
